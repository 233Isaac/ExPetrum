But sometimes a person looks up to the stars in the sky and asks a question. A very important one. 'What if?' is tht question. Ex Petrum answers the question 'What if Minecraft was based on real life as we know it?'. Note that this mod is not supposed to be a continuation or an update of TFC(in fact I have nothing to do with TFC) but TFC(aka TerraFirmaCraft) has been a source of inspiration for me, so go and check it out, it is a really well done mod!",
